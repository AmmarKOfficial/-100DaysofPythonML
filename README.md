<h1>100DaysOfPythonML</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my #100DaysofPythonML challenge! In this challenge, I will commit to learning Python and Machine Learning for 100 consecutive days and sharing my progress on LinkedIn.</h2>

This repository will serve as a log of my progress, where I will document my daily progress, code snippets, tutorials, and resources that I find helpful. Through this challenge, I hope to explore different aspects of Python programming and Machine Learning, including data structures, algorithms, data analysis, data visualization, and more. I will also learn about popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn, which are commonly used in data science projects.

I encourage you to join me on this journey and to take up the #100DaysofPythonML challenge. Together, we can learn and grow our skills in Python programming and Machine Learning. Let's inspire and support each other as we embark on this exciting learning journey!

<h2>Thank you for following my progress, and happy coding!</h2>
