<h1>Day-2/100</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my repository on Python Expressions and Operators, Conditional Statements If-Else, and Basic Input-Output!</h2>

Python is a powerful programming language that offers a wide range of operators for arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operations. Expressions in Python are a combination of operators, values, and variables that can be evaluated to obtain a result.

In this repository, I will be exploring different types of operators and expressions, including arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /), logical operators (and, or, not), comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=), and bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>).

Additionally, I will be learning about conditional statements such as if-else statements that allow for branching in the code based on certain conditions. I will cover how to write basic conditional statements, including how to use logical operators and comparison operators in conditional statements.

Finally, I will explore basic input-output functions in Python, including how to take user input from the console and display output on the console.

Here are some key takeaways for each topic covered in this repository:

Expressions and Operators: Learn about the different types of operators available in Python and how to combine them to create expressions that can be evaluated to obtain a result.
Conditional Statements If-Else: Understand how to use conditional statements to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.
Basic Input-Output: Learn how to take user input from the console and display output on the console.
