<h1>Welcome to Day 6 of my #100DaysOfPythonML Challenge!</h1>

</h2>Today, I continued my learning journey on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Specifically, I learned about classes and instances, class variables, class methods, and static methods.</h2>

Here's a brief overview of what I learned today:

Classes and Instances: Classes are blueprints or templates for creating objects, and instances are individual objects created from a class.
Class Variables: Class variables are variables that are shared by all instances of a class, and they can be accessed and modified by any instance of the class.
Class Methods: Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class, and they can be used to modify the class state or perform some other class-level action.
Static Methods: Static methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class, but they don't take the class or instance as an argument. They are used to perform some utility function that doesn't involve the instance or class state.
By understanding these OOP concepts in Python, I can write more efficient, scalable, and maintainable code for Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning projects.
