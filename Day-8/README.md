<h1> Day 8: Getters, Setters, and Deleters</h1>

<h2>Welcome to the Property Decorators repository! In this project, we'll be exploring the concept of Property Decorators in Python, with a focus on Getters, Setters, and Deleters.</h2>

On Day 8 of the #100DaysOfPythonML challenge, we learned about the implementation of Property Decorators in Python, specifically how to use Getters, Setters, and Deleters to manage class attributes.

Getters are used to retrieve the value of an attribute, and are implemented using the @property decorator.
Setters are used to set the value of an attribute, and are implemented using the @<attribute>.setter decorator.
Deleters are used to delete the attribute of an instance, and are implemented using the @<attribute>.deleter decorator.
Using these Property Decorators allows us to manage class attributes in a controlled and efficient manner, ensuring that attributes are accessed, modified, and deleted according to specific rules.

<h2>Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to explore the exciting world of Python and Machine Learning in the #100DaysOfPythonML challenge!</h2>
