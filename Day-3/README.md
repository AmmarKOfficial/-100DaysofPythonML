<h1>Welcome to Day 3/100 of #100DaysOfPythonML Challenge!</h1>

<h2>oday, I learned about different types of data structures in Python, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings. Data structures are a way to organize and store data in a structured way that makes it easy to access and manipulate.</h2>T

Here is a brief overview of the data structures I covered today and their associated functions:

Lists: Lists are a collection of elements, and they are mutable (i.e., can be changed). Some common functions associated with lists include append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), sort(), and reverse().
Tuples: Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable (i.e., cannot be changed). Some common functions associated with tuples include count() and index().
Dictionaries: Dictionaries are a collection of key-value pairs, and they are mutable. Some common functions associated with dictionaries include keys(), values(), items(), get(), and update().
Sets: Sets are a collection of unique elements, and they are mutable. Some common functions associated with sets include add(), remove(), pop(), union(), intersection(), and difference().
Strings: Strings are a sequence of characters, and they are immutable. Some common functions associated with strings include upper(), lower(), strip(), replace(), split(), and join().
By understanding these data structures and their associated functions, I can write efficient code that is easy to read and maintain.
