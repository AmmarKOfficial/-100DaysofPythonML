<h1>Recursion in Python </h1>

<h2>On Day 9 of the #100DaysOfPythonML challenge, I have been exploring the concept of recursion in Python programming. Recursion is a powerful technique that involves breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems, and solving each sub-problem recursively until the solution to the original problem is reached.</h2>

To gain a better understanding of recursion, I have implemented a small basic factorial program using recursion in Python. This program demonstrates how recursion can be used to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems.

In this repository, you can find the code for the factorial program that I have implemented using recursion. I have also included detailed explanations and comments in the code to help you understand the logic behind the implementation.

<h2>Thank you for following along on this journey with me. Feel free to explore the repository and learn more about recursion in Python programming.</h2>
