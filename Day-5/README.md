<h1>Welcome to Day 5 of my #100DaysOfPythonML Challenge!</h1>

<h2>Today, I learned about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, one of the most important concepts in modern programming. Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code to manipulate that data.</h2>

I learned about why OOP is used and how it can make code more organized, maintainable, and reusable. I also learned about the concepts of classes and objects and how to define them in Python. Classes are templates or blueprints for creating objects, and objects are instances of classes.

Here's a brief overview of what I learned today:

What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Why use OOP and how it can benefit your code
What are classes and objects in Python
How to define classes and objects in Python
By understanding OOP concepts in Python, I can write more efficient, scalable, and maintainable code for Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning projects.
