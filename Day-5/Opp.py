# Classes and Objects in Python

#For Saler 1
sales = 6000
profit = 2000
ad = 1000

#For Saler 2
sales2 = 6000
profit2 = 2000
ad2 = 1000

# In normal procedural programming we have to store all the data individually for all the saler so why not 
# create a class where all the data belong to same person and we can acess like ammar.saels, ammar.ad, ammar.profit we can save all the data together
# in class and acess by object

# RailwayForm --- Class   (Blueprint)
# Ammar --> Ammar ki info wala form ---> Object(Entity)
# Sharry --> Sharry ki info wala form ---> Object(Entity)
# Mano ---> Mano ki info wala form ---> Object(Entity)

#Ammar.trainName('XYZ') Thsi is the method on class 

# Encapsulation (Filling data to the values of class)
# Inhertence (Class linked to class) (Cycle + Engine --> Bike + 4 Wheel --> Car)

# Opp is used to map real world entites so that urderstanding of program get easier
