<h1>Welcome to Day 4/100 of my #100DaysOfPythonML Challenge!</h1>

<h2>Today, I learned about Python functions and how to define and call them in a Python program. Functions are a set of instructions that are grouped together to perform a specific task. They make the code more organized, readable, and reusable.</h>

I learned about defining functions, passing arguments to a function, and returning values from a function. I also learned about different types of arguments in Python, including required arguments, default arguments, keyword arguments, and variable-length arguments.

Here is a brief overview of what I learned today:

Defining functions using the def keyword
Passing arguments to a function
Returning values from a function
Required arguments, default arguments, keyword arguments, and variable-length arguments
By understanding functions and arguments in Python, I can write modular and reusable code that is easy to maintain.
