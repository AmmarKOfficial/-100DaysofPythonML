<h1>Day 7: Class Instantiation and Special Dunder Methods</h1>

<h2>Today, I continued to dive deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Specifically, I learned about class instantiation and special dunder methods.</h2>

Class Instantiation
In Python, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. The process of creating an object from a class is called instantiation. During instantiation, a new instance of the class is created, and the object's attributes and methods are set to their initial values.

Special Dunder Methods
Special dunder methods (short for "double underscore") are special methods in Python that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their name. These methods are automatically called by Python in response to certain events or actions. For example, the **init** method is a dunder method that is called when an object is created.

By using dunder methods, I can define custom behavior for objects in Python. For instance, I can define how an object should be printed when print() is called on it, or how it should be compared to other objects using operators like == and <.

<h2>Overall, today's learning focused on the more advanced concepts of OOP in Python. By understanding class instantiation and special dunder methods, I can create more flexible and customized objects in my Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning projects.</h2>
