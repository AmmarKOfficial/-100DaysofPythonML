<h1> Day 10 / 100 of 100DaysOfPythonML</h1>

<h2>This repository contains my progress and learnings from the #100DaysofPythonML challenge, where I am committing to learning Python and Machine Learning for 100 consecutive days and sharing my progress on LinkedIn.</h2>

Through this challenge, I am exploring different aspects of Python programming and Machine Learning, including data structures, algorithms, data analysis, data visualization, and more. I am also learning about popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn, which are commonly used in data science projects.

On Day 10, I learned about Python Flask, a popular web framework for building web applications using Python. Flask is a lightweight framework that is easy to use and perfect for creating small to medium-sized web applications. With Flask, I can quickly create web pages, handle user input, and interact with databases.

Throughout the challenge, I will be sharing my progress and learnings on LinkedIn, and documenting them in this repository. This will serve as a log of my progress, and also as a reference for others who are learning Python and Machine Learning.

In addition to the daily progress updates, I will also include code snippets, tutorials, and resources that I find helpful. I hope that this repository will inspire others to take up the #100DaysofPythonML challenge and to continue their learning journey in Python and Machine Learning.

<h2>Thank you for joining me on this journey, and happy coding!</h2>
